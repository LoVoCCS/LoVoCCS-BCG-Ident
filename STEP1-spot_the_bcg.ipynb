    "Optical and near-infrared wavelengths are where galaxies in general emit the most light, and thus are easiest to see and identify. You will be looking at optical images that I have taken from the 'Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument' (DESI) Legacy Survey, which is essentially  a set of uniformly processed observations (some were in the telescope archives from other projects, some they proposed for specifically) that they combined and analysed - this was all to identify targets for DESI (which takes optical/near-infrared *spectra* rather than the images you are looking at). They also have an [online viewer for their survey](https://www.legacysurvey.org/viewer#IC%202455) which is pretty great (if a little slow sometimes).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task you will also be able to view the X-ray emission from the galaxy cluster itself - this is in another image to the right hand side, and is mostly there to provide some context for where the galaxy cluster is and where to start looking for the BCGs. The X-ray data are from a European Space Agency (ESA) telescope called XMM-Newton, which is particularly good for a lot of galaxy cluster work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are you looking for?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A collection of yellow-ish galaxies, with an elliptical shape - these will likely be cluster members. With enough experience it is possible to look at an image and say whether there is a cluster there or not, but you won't have this problem as **all of the optical images are centered on the X-ray coordinates of known galaxy clusters**.\n",
    "2. Of those galaxies, are there any that stand out as **being much larger than the others?**\n",
    "3. When you click on them and the cross-hair appears, are they within the bright extended source in the X-ray image? It is also possible that they are BCGs of another galaxy cluster in the field, so when you click does the cross seem to be associated with another extended X-ray source?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A suggestion for a procedure to use:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify the extended X-ray source we're centered on (by looking for the center of the red box on the X-ray image - you can also click in the centre of the optical image to put a cross-hair down).\n",
    "2. Search for a population of yellow elliptical galaxies in the optical image.\n",
    "3. Judge if any of those galaxies are larger and brighter than the others (there might be more than one, there might be none).\n",
    "4. Click on these galaxies, see if the cross-hair falls within the extended X-ray source we are centered on (if it falls within another extended source we are still interested, but I would like you to make a note of the name, and whether it is the first, second, third, etc. candidate you have saved).\n",
    "5. Zoom closer on the candidate galaxy and adjust the cross-hair to be at the center of the brightest innermost region - **you don't need to take too long on this, the cross hair being absolutely dead center is not essential, and would be a waste of your time**.\n",
    "6. Click the save button, and move on to the next candidate you identified in step 4 (if there are any others).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes on the tool**\n",
    "\n",
    "* When you save a BCG candidate, the cross-hair will disappear, and a small white circle will be added to the visualisation.\n",
    "* Saving writes some information about that galaxy to the BCG candidate sample file (in the outputs directory).\n",
    "* If you make a mistake, you can hit the reset button (just below the save button in the toolbar) - this will remove **all** BCG candidates, and their entries in the candidate sample file.\n",
    "* You may not be able to identify any candidates - in that case you have to click 'No BCG candidates' button, just below the reset button (this can also be reset though, if you clicked it accidentally).\n",
    "* When you've zoomed in, you can reset back to the original view by clicking the home button at the top of the toolbar.\n",
    "* If you have clicked the 'zoom to rectangle' button, you will need to click it again before you can make new cross-hairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "***After each session (not after every cluster) of identifying BCGs you should back-up the BCG candidate sample file in the 'outputs' directory.***"
